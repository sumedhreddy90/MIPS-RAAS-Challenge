# MIPS-RAAS-Challenge

TODO:

1) perform waypoint navigation with px4 based UAV in gazebo environment; simple square pattern is enough. 
2) Land UAVs on aruco marker after finishing the square pattern 
3) add a Husky model into the same environment with a single UAV and make them perform square pattern independently 
4) Make UAV land on UGV which has an aruco marker on top of it
5) do the same with an extra UAV and UGV (team of two UAV-UGV couple)
